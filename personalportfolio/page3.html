                People will visit my portfolio website to learn more about my work, skills, and the projects I've completed. As a personal portfolio, the goal is to showcase my abilities and demonstrate how my work aligns with the needs of potential employers, clients, or collaborators. Visitors will come seeking a comprehensive, visually appealing display of my accomplishments and a clear representation of my professional abilities. I want them to get a sense of who I am, how I approach problems, and what kind of projects I’m capable of handling. Whether they're looking for a designer, developer, or writer, my website will offer a glimpse into my versatility and adaptability in various fields.

                Questions Visitors May Have One of the key questions visitors will expect my site to answer is: "What can this person do for me?" They want to know what value I can bring to their projects or company. They might also want to know about my background—such as education, experience, and any specific expertise in certain areas. Visitors will also likely ask, “What have they worked on?” and expect to see a portfolio of work that demonstrates the quality and breadth of my capabilities. They may also inquire about my availability or how to get in touch with me, so clear contact information and call-to-action buttons will be crucial.
